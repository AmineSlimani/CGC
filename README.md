# Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients (CGC) - Direct Computation

## Overview  
**CGC (Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients)** is a Python implementation of a direct method to compute Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This approach is designed for cases where the total angular momentum \( J \) is maximal, i.e., \( J = J_1 + J_2 \). The method improves computational efficiency by eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps.

## Features  
✅ Direct computation of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients  
✅ Optimized for cases where \( J = J_1 + J_2 \)  
✅ Simple Python implementation with minimal dependencies
